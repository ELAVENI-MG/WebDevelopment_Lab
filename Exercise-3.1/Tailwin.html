        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">Ancient Origins</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>1. Ancient Egypt (Around 2600 BCE):</strong> The earliest forms of cake can be traced to ancient Egypt, where baked goods were made with flour, eggs, honey, and milk. These early cakes were more like bread but sweetened with honey and enriched with other natural flavors.</p>
        
        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>2. Ancient Greece (Around 500 BCE):</strong> The Greeks made a form of cake called "plakous," which was flat and made with nuts and honey. They also made "satura," a dense, flat cake similar to early bread.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>3. Ancient Rome:</strong> The Romans developed early cakes by adapting the Greek recipes, using ingredients like flour, eggs, butter, honey, and nuts. Roman cakes were often served at celebrations and included some fruit, which began to distinguish them from bread.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Medieval Period</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>Europe (Middle Ages, 5th to 15th centuries):</strong> Cakes evolved further during the medieval period, as baking techniques improved. By this time, cakes were more distinguishable from bread. They were usually spiced and sweetened with honey or dried fruits. Cakes were typically made for religious ceremonies or festive occasions.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">17th Century (Modern Cakes)</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>Western Europe:</strong> Modern cakes began to take shape in the 17th century with the introduction of refined sugar and new baking techniques. The use of beaten eggs, leavening agents (like yeast), and icing transformed cakes into celebratory desserts.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">18th Century (Refinement of Cake Baking)</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>1. Introduction of Ovens:</strong> The 18th century saw the rise of ovens in home kitchens. These ovens allowed for more controlled baking conditions, resulting in softer, more refined cakes.</p>
        
        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>2. Refinement in Ingredients:</strong> During this century, cakes became more refined, with the introduction of specialized cake molds, tools, and the use of finer flour. Frosting and icing techniques improved, giving cakes a more luxurious appearance.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>3. Cake as a Status Symbol:</strong> Cakes, especially large and elaborately decorated ones, were often used by the upper classes as a symbol of wealth and status at large gatherings and banquets.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">19th Century (Baking Powder Era)</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>Introduction of Baking Powder (Mid-19th Century):</strong> The invention of baking powder in the 19th century revolutionized cake-making. It allowed cakes to rise without the need for yeast, resulting in the soft, fluffy cakes we're familiar with today.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">20th Century (Industrialization and Modern Cakes)</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>1. Mass Production of Ingredients:</strong> The industrial revolution and mass production techniques made cake ingredients like flour, sugar, and butter more affordable and accessible. Pre-packaged cake mixes became available in the 1930s and 1940s, making cake-baking easier for home bakers.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>2. Introduction of Electric Ovens:</strong> The 20th century saw the rise of electric ovens, providing consistent baking temperatures, making cake baking easier and more reliable.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>3. Variety in Cake Types:</strong> The century introduced iconic cakes like Angel Food Cake, Devil's Food Cake, Cheesecakes, and Sponge Cakes.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>4. Decoration and Icing Innovation:</strong> Cake decoration became more intricate with the rise of fondant and frosting techniques. Tiered and layered cakes for celebrations also became popular.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">21st Century (Modern Cake Trends)</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>1. Rise of Customization:</strong> Customized 3D and sculpted cakes have become popular for special events, pushing creativity in cake design.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>2. Dietary Trends and Alternatives:</strong> Cakes catering to dietary preferences (gluten-free, vegan, etc.) have grown in popularity, using alternative ingredients like almond flour or agave syrup.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>3. Influence of Social Media:</strong> Platforms like Instagram and YouTube have turned cake artistry into a global trend, with cake decorating tutorials and influencers popularizing creative designs.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>4. Edible Printing and Technology:</strong> Edible printing allows intricate designs on cakes, and 3D printing is even used for decorations.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>5. Cake Pops and Cupcakes:</strong> Miniature cakes like cake pops and cupcakes are convenient and widely popular for parties and events.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-2">The history of cakes is a fascinating journey from simple, bread-like sweetened loaves to the elaborate and diverse confections we enjoy today.
