            Orange cake is a delightful dessert that combines the tangy sweetness of oranges with the rich, moist texture of a traditional cake. The vibrant hue and zesty aroma make it a popular choice for various occasions, from casual tea parties to festive celebrations.
            The cake can be enjoyed on its own, but it's often enhanced with toppings like whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, or a drizzle of orange glaze. The citrusy notes in the cake complement these additions, creating a harmonious and delightful taste experience.
            There are many variations of orange cake, each with its own unique twist. Some recipes incorporate orange zest and juice into the batter, while others use orange-flavored extracts or essences. Some cakes are topped with orange-flavored frosting or a simple dusting of powdered sugar. No matter your preference, there's an orange cake recipe out there to suit your taste.
