            The rhinoceros, commonly known as the rhino, is a large, powerful herbivore known for its thick skin and distinctive horn or horns on its snout. There are five species of rhinos: two native to Africa (the black rhino and white rhino) and three to Asia (the Indian rhino, Javan rhino, and Sumatran rhino). Rhinos are mostly solitary animals, with the exception of females and their calves. They are often found in savannas, grasslands, and tropical forests, depending on the species. Despite their size and strength, rhinos are endangered due to poaching for their horns, which are mistakenly believed to have medicinal properties, and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these majestic creatures from extinction.Rhinos communicate with one another using vocalizations like grunts, growls, and snorts. They also mark their territory with dung and urine, which contains chemical signals for other rhinos.
