            Pineapple cake is a delightful dessert that combines the sweet, tangy flavors of pineapple with a moist, tender cake base. Often made by incorporating pineapple juice or crushed pineapple into the batter, this cake is known for its rich, fruity taste. One popular variation is the pineapple upside-down cake, where pineapple rings and maraschino cherries are arranged at the bottom of a pan, topped with brown sugar and butter, and then baked with cake batter. After baking, the cake is inverted, revealing a caramelized fruit topping that adds a juicy, tangy contrast to the soft cake. Another variation is the Taiwanese pineapple cake, a traditional pastry with a crumbly shortbread-like crust filled with a sweet-tart pineapple jam. Whether served as a classic upside-down cake or as a Taiwanese specialty, pineapple cake is loved for its refreshing tropical flavor.
